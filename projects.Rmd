This project studies how QAnon believers used Twitter and whether they were able to grow their influence on Twitter. Specifically, we investigate the social media use and news media uptake of Twitter users, who claimed to be QAnon believers; and we link their Twitter activity to their follower growth. This project seeks to understand this community and its growth, as seen on Twitter and news media.

This project investigates the power of #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, and #StopAsianHate movements on Twitter by focusing on the participants. We examine how they participated in the three movements and to what extent they channeled their attention from one movement to another.
