### From #StayWoke to #WokeMindVirus

With its openness and connectivity, social media can successfully amplify voices from traditionally marginalized people (Freelon et al., 2018; Jackson & Foucault Welles, 2015) as well as bad actors and extremists (Garry et al., 2021). Research has begun to show the multi-platform nature of such processes. In analyzing Russian IRA disinformation campaign, Lukito (2019) reveals its temporal coordination between Twitter and Reddit, and Golovchenko and colleagues (2020) show the prevalence of Twitter posts embedding links to YouTube videos. Additionally, de Zeeuw and colleagues (2020) trace the mainstreaming of the QAnon conspiracy theory, traveling from 4chan to Reddit and YouTube. Building on the increase in multi-platform studies, we advance our theoretical argument on platform interrelation and ask how social media platforms separately and synergistically shaped the transformation of the meaning and usage of “wokeness” in public discourse.

### Elon Musk and Twitter

With social media platforms increasingly sinking into nearly all aspects of society (Van Dijck, 2021) and concerns over the spread of mis- and dis-information on various platforms (Grinberg et al., 2019), platform governance has come to public, media, and academic spotlight in recent years. Platform governance involves multiple players, including “platform companies, users, advertisers, governments, and other political actors” (Gorwa, 2019). In particular, some platforms are significantly tied to their owners, like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Donald Trump of Truth Social. Most recently, Elon Musk’s takeover of one of the most influential platforms, Twitter, has ignited debates about privatization of public sphere, content moderation (and restoration of controversial accounts), and their political consequences. This raises questions about the role that a single person can/should have in impacting public discourse on a platform. Building on platform governance (Van Dijck & Poell, 2013) and social media public opinion (Zhang et al., 2022) scholarship, we conceptualize social media discourses surrounding platform governance as an expression of public opinion and an object with business impact. By examining how platform ownership change might impact the intensity of, engagement with, and topics in platform governance discourses, we seek to contribute to our understanding of how the democratic and capitalist aspects of platforms are intertwined.  

## Completed:

### #MeToo cross-platform discourses

This project situates our analysis in discourses on sexual violence and gender justice activism on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit. We propose a three-pronged framework to understand discourses surrounding social media activism initiated by networked counterpublics: personal expression that raises public consciousness and fosters social support, calls to action that demand social changes, and contention that can either invigorate or stymie action. We use supervised machine learning to classify three discourses (networked acknowledgement, calls to action, and feminism contention) and apply time series analysis to model their interrelations. 

Results show that networked acknowledgment stimulates both calls to action and feminism contention and that calls to action predicts feminism contention across all platforms. Also, these discourses were more sensitive to various events on Twitter and Facebook, but more ephemeral and cyclical on Instagram and more persistent and mutually reinforcing on Reddit. These findings underscore the opportunities and challenges in social media activism and articulate cross-platform similarities and differences. 

### Accumulation of influence on social media

Though the use of social media by peripheral groups in society has received rising scholarly attention, it remains unclear how social media might contribute to their increased influence and how their social media activity evolves over time. In this project, we study actors’ strategic performance on social media, social media audience’s reaction, and news media amplification of their strategic performance, all of which might fuel each other to catapult peripheral actors to prominence. 

Through an analysis of 242 QAnon Twitter accounts using topic modeling and time series modeling, we find that QAnon accounts performed their group identity that helped them attract social media audience reaction, which in turn reinforced their group identity-based performance and drove news media amplification. These results highlight the implications of social media and news media for the normalization of peripheral actors and ideologies.

### Mapping the social media ecosystem

Extending research on the technological features and user practices of social media, this article theorizes social media as an ecosystem consisting of simultaneously differentiated yet interconnected platforms. We argue that how platforms are interconnected in this ecosystem is shaped by social media users’ cross-platform and cross-media sharing practices, which result in the dissemination of information across the social media ecosystem via hyperlinks. Using two distinct large-scale datasets on prominent issues in the U.S. and a rigorous manual coding of link domains, we investigate the linking patterns of 187 platforms. Our results reveal the prominent role of cross-media sharing within the social media ecosystem, with center-left and right-wing news being shared most frequently. Also, YouTube and Twitter emerge as two leading platforms facilitating interconnections among others. Providing robust empirical evidence, this study advances our theoretical understanding of social media platforms as forming an ecosystem connected through users’ sharing practices.

### The politicization and polarization of the #MeToo movement

With existing research showing the fragilities of social media activism and the stubbornness of partisan beliefs and attitudes, we examine whether partisans politicize social media activism. Politicization is conceptualized as partisans crowding out non-partisan participants, dominating conversations and debates, and weaving selective events into narratives. Our large-scale and multi-layered computational analysis of discourses surrounding the #MeToo movement is based on a comprehensive list of related accusations and a vast corpus of all #MeToo tweets. Through cluster analysis of the retweet network, we identified different groups and found that partisan users accounted for the overwhelming majority of the tweets. In the next step, we will apply supervised machine learning to classify different expressions and use time series modeling to examine the relationship between features of accusations and types of expressions.
